If you don't want to feel the awful burden of Time breaking your shoulders and pressing you to the ground, you must be ceaselessly drunk. But on what? On wine, poetry, virtue ... whatever you want.

                <p class="abel-font text-center">Klein states that there is a reason for this. "Nature invented positive feelings to seduce us into useful behavior." (p 203) Scientists tested this out on rats. When the rats were hungry they learned to press a lever, which releases nutrients directly into their stomachs, bypassing the taste receptors. The rats ended up losing a third of their weight within a few weeks. "The pleasure that eating gives us is anything but a luxury." (Klein p 203)</p>

                <p class="abel-font text-center">Humans have developed many taste buds, many of which serve a purpose. The reason sugar brings us so much joy is that nature made creatures to take in as much nourishment as possible. Sugar is straight energy. We can only take so much of bitter or sour things because most poisons are bitter and most sour fruits aren't ripe.</p>

                <p class="abel-font text-center">Sex is one of the best examples in regards to the seesaw of emotions. At times we feel as though we NEED sex, this is because we are programmed to procreate. The act of sex and orgasm creates an immense amount of pleasure, which is what drives a species to procreate. Without it we may go extinct. Once it is over though, the rush of pleasure dissipates rather quickly. The need has been met, the balance has returned.</p>

          <p class="abel-font text-center">Stefan Klein is a big believer of happiness, pleasure, and enjoyment being an evolutionary trait. When our bodies need nourishment our brain releases dynorphins, which are the opposite of endorphins and in turns causes hunger pains. Eating brings these chemicals back into balance and makes you feel happy for a period of time. We are driven by desire, whatever we need in the moment is what will bring us happiness. If you are in the freezing cold nothing would make you more happy than a hot fireplace. This science of the balance of emotions can show us why someone with all the luxuries one could want, can still be depressed. The initial shock of endorphins from acquiring something you desire is great but if you have instant access to anything you desire then you never will get that release of endorphins. Life and happiness seems to be about balanc. What is happiness if you've never experienced unhappiness?</p>
